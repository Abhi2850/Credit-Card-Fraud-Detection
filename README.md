# Description
The Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem includes modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud. So,this system is used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. Our aim here is to detect 100% of the fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications.

# Objective
The aim of this project is to detect fraud transactions with the help of using credit card details. It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not pay for.

## Steps
* Importing necessary Python Libraries
* Loading the data 
* Performing EDA
* Visualizing and Analyzing various factors using Scatter plot, Box plot and Heat map.
* Handling the Unbalanced data using various methods
* Model training and testing.
* getting the accuracy with different hyperparameter tunning
